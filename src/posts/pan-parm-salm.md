#### Ingredients
* `200 gr` Salmon fillet with skin - cut into 2 pieces
* Parsley (as needed)
* `quarter` cloves of garlic - minced well
* `18-22 gr` Parmesan cheese 
*  garlic powder (optional)


#### Instructions
1. Heat the pan you're going to use. Drizzle olive oil.
2. Put the fillet onto the pan, skin is facing down (the pan).
3. While waiting for the salmon, mix the parmesan, parsley, and minced garlic well.
4. Halfway (around ~8 mins), put the mixture on top of the salmon. 
5. No need to flip the fish. Cook for 5-7 more mins (the duration is based on preference). 
6. Ready!


#### Additional Notes
* The next time I'm cooking this, I'll grill the garlic clove for a few then mince them to get slightly smoky flavor.
* I mixed the Parmesan with dried, grated cheddar.
* For better result, use non-stick pan.
* Adjust the duration accordingly.
