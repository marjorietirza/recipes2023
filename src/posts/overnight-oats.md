#### Ingredients
* `50 gr` rolled oats
* `70-80 ml` milk
* `1 tbs` chia seed (optional)
*  `quarter tsp` honey (optional)
*  fresh cut fruits (optional)
*  peanut butter (optional)


#### Instructions
1. Prep a cleaned, clear jar with seal.
2. Add rolled oats, followed by milk into the jar. 
3. __(optional)__ Add honey/peanut butter/any preferred flavor.
4. Stir and mix lightly.
5. __(optional)__ Spread chia seed on top of the oat mixture evenly.
6. Seal the jar and store it in the fridge overnight.
7. Add fruits of choice before serve
8. Ready!


#### Additional Notes
* I prefer plain oat & milk mixture and choose to add fruit(s) for flavor instead.
* Works with all kinds of milk and milk substitute.
* If you're flexible with time, try not to add the fruit early. You don't want soggy fruits.
