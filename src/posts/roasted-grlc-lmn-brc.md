#### Ingredients
* `1 head` broccoli - cut into medium pieces
* juice from `half` lemon
*  oil (as needed)
*  salt (as needed)
*  chopped garlic or garlic powder (as needed)
*  pepper (optional)


#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to `~170-180Â°C`. Waiting time ~5-7 mins. Prepare parchment paper or just grease the pan.
2. Put and spread broccoli on the pan. Then, drizzle them with oil. 
3. Add garlic, salt, and pepper.
4. Spread and toss to make sure they are coated evenly before adding the lemon juice.
5. Drizzle lemon juice.
6. Bake them for ~20 mins. If you prefer them less crispy, bake it a little longer.
7. Ready!


#### Additional Notes
* I always use olive oil. So if you only have cooking oil, maybe add more seasoning.
* For better taste, drizzle more lemon juice after removing them from the oven.
* Eat them along side a protein
